The project_name: _FILL_ME_IN_

1. Create a DEV folder:
Check out https://github.com/symunona/obsidian-hermes.git repo into ~/dev/tmp/agents/obsidian-hermes-[project_name]

2. branch off, create a new branch called agent/[project_name]

3. See if the plan makes sense to you

4. answer all of these questions:
- are there any architectural changes this needs?
- are there anything that's not clear from the project description, that should be clarified?

3. Implement plan/[project_name].md plan in the DEV folder.
If you'd need to edit a lot of EXISTING files, ask yourself: is this an architectural change?
If so, ask for approval.

4. When done, push to GitHub

5. Create a PR when done.

6. List all the more complicated questions that came up during the process. Show a short summary of what happened!
